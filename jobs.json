We see these retreats as an opportunity to strengthen the social fiber of our community. This team is growing in more ways than one - weâve recently launched 14 babies (and counting!). \n\nUnanimously, our favorite and most impactful value is âBuild a house you want to live in.â We strive to make decisions that are authentic for our organization.

    "description": "#What is the job?\n\nNo matter how powerful and flexible you build a platform, at the end of the day itâs the tools you present to the user that define the experience. Radix is seeking a savvy UX expert to come build the experiences that will define the future of decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nDeFi has turned out to be the killer app that is taking public distributed ledgers from niche products for speculators and hobbyists to projects of global economic significance, and with it has come a new paradigm for user interfaces. Authentication models, interoperability expectations, and the entire concept of user accounts are all undergoing dramatic changes; at Radix youâll have the opportunity to define the way forward while working at the very cutting edge of a space undergoing furious growth.\n\nWorking from a series of end-to-end user scenarios, you will wireframe delightful user experiences and pitch your design to a team of brilliant folks who care very deeply about the end result. Next, youâll work with artists and UI experts to produce a consumable design with appropriate fonts, colors and iconography, after which youâll move on to implementation with a small team. Youâll be primarily focused on delivering the front-end, but expect a healthy dose of implementing the requisite services you will consume, as well.\n\n#What are we looking for?\n\nYouâre able to isolate the 90% case for user experiences. You think in terms of making the most common interactions effortless, rather than making anything possible.\nWhen discussing new capabilities, your first instinct is to think of the user story rather than the feature set.\nYou donât get wedded to ideas. Youâre not reluctant to throw prototypes away when something isnât working.\nYouâre a confident coder who has built public-facing user interfaces in the past. You have some experience building REST services and/or WebSocket backends.\nYouâre intelligent and learn quickly. Absolutely no one at Radix winds up only doing whatâs in their job description, and adaptability is essential.\n\n#What do you need?\n\n4+ years as a professional software engineer\n\nFluent in JavaScript and TypeScript\n\nFluent with React or Vue\n\nComfortable with Java or C#\n\nA love for all things crypto is a huge plus!\n\n#Who are we?\n\nAt Radix, we're a team of like-minded thinkers who have long been convinced that we're living in the earliest stages of a global financial revolution. This revolution is being fuelled by decentralized finance (or DeFi for short), which is enabling an assortment of pioneering developers and entrepreneurs to re-invent almost every financial product that is currently traded and invested in traditional markets, without requiring central authorities or siloed infrastructure. DeFi has captured a great deal of attention and investment in the crypto-aware niche, growing assets under management from $1 billion to $40 billion in less than a year. Impressive as its growth has been, its current market size isn't even a rounding error on the over $111 trillion held in traditional finance. We're focused on what it will take to go from billions to trillions.\n\nRadix went back to first principles to come up with the right technical solutionâthe first layer-one protocol built specifically for mainstream DeFiâand we have already tested out at over 1 million transactions per second. We're keenly aware that the need for an infinitely scalable platform is only one prerequisite among many for mass adoption, and we're also blazing new ground in the areas of purpose-built developer tools, user experiences, and regulatory integration.\n\nWe have forged a path deep into the future of what distributed ledger technology is going to look like and we need you to come and be part of the team that is making that happen right now.",

    "description": "<p><em>Lead a dynamic technology team working to improve millions of lives.</em></p><br /><p><strong>Overview</strong></p><br /><p>Simprints builds innovative technology aimed to help some of the world's most vulnerable and marginalised populations access essential services. We work to radically increase transparency and effectiveness in global development, making sure that every vaccine, every dollar, every public good reaches the people who need them most. We design and develop both hardware and software by applying modern tools and pioneering technology in new, challenging contexts where there is little to no internet connectivity. Simprints is currently on track to help over 1.4 million people access critical services by 2021.</p><br /><p>We are looking for a Director of Engineering who is passionate about delivering great technology and building a high-performing engineering team. Since Simprints has multiple engineering disciplines covering mobile, cloud, firmware, and hardware, we are seeking someone comfortable working with engineers of many stripes to deliver technology at scale. The ideal candidate will bring a mix of technical and managerial skills to build and support their team of 10-15 staff, using people management, hiring, and culture as primary levers for enabling team success. If building technology for global health sounds exciting, we want to meet you! </p><br /><p>Our headquarters is located in Cambridge, UK. We like collaboration and speak to each other several times a day - between 10am and 3pm UK time. To keep the collaborative team spirit we are looking for colleagues in GMT -2/+3 - or colleagues who are able to relocate to the UK. UK visa sponsorship support will be considered on a case by case basis. At the time being, we will only be considering applicants within these parameters.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Deliver a high-quality product to our clients by leading and working closely with the product owners and engineers across the organization</li><br /><li>Build and lead a team of technical leaders, including engineering managers and technical leads, cultivating an environment of psychological safety and continuous learning</li><br /><li>Optimise engineering processes and resourcing across the core platform and project delivery engineering teams to deliver a sustainable and seamless flow of value</li><br /><li>Optimise engineering hiring processes to ensure Simprints attracts top talent</li><br /><li>Contribute to company-wide strategy and decision making as part of the leadership team</li><br /></ul><br /><strong><span><span>MUST HAVE</span><span> REQUIREMENTS</span></span></strong><br /><br /><ul><br /><li><strong>Foundational knowledge of software development processes and testing</strong>. You believe in shipping quality products and care about having the right processes and testing to make it happen. Although you&rsquo;re no stranger to pivots, you like it when the trains run well and on time.</li><br /><li><strong>Experience working in a team with a focus on code quality</strong>. You&rsquo;re happy in environments where design documents, testing, code reviews, and continuous integration are the norm. </li><br /><li><strong>Excellent written and verbal communication skills.</strong>You&rsquo;ve learned that crafting good technology requires great communication, and you can do that effectively on multiple levels: with engineers deep in day-to-day development and with teammates from across the company needing to see the bigger picture</li><br /><li><strong>Track record of great management. </strong>You&rsquo;re an experienced manager who can bring the best of direct reports through feedback, coaching, and aligned goal-setting. You&rsquo;re confident managing those who are already capable contributors as well as those who need more hands-on guidance</li><br /></ul><br /><strong><span><span>NICE TO HAVE</span><span> REQUIREMENTS</span></span></strong><br /><br /><ul><br /><li>Former engineer with familiarity in Android, Backend (go lang), Embedded development and/or hardware design and manufacturing</li><br /><li>Familiarity with designing hiring processes to optimise for candidate quality, a positive applicant experience, and manageable burden on the team</li><br /><li>Organisational leadership skills to design structures to get the most out of each personality on the team</li><br /><li>Direct experience working as a mobile, backend, or other flavours of engineer</li><br /></ul><br /><strong><span>WE OFFER</span></strong><br /><br /><p><strong>7 reasons to join Simprints</strong></p><br /><p>Life is short. We believe work should be awesome, meaningful, and fun. At Simprints we&rsquo;re taking on global development&rsquo;s biggest challenges, powered by incredible people and great partners. Some reasons to join this adventure:</p><br /><ul><br /><li><strong>Genuine impact.</strong> This is the opportunity to spearhead our engineering team and develop technology whose impact will reach millions of beneficiaries.</li><br /><li><strong>Work with great engineers using cutting edge tools. Work with engineers committed to writing high-quality code and the latest technologies, including:</strong></li><br /></ul><br /><p>Languages: Kotlin, Go, Typescript</p><br /><p>Android libraries: Jetpack, Coroutines, Koin</p><br /><p>Cloud infrastructure: Firebase, BigQuery, Cloud Functions, lots of other GCP tools</p><br /><p>Other tools: Bitbucket Pipelines, Jira</p><br /><ul><br /><li><strong>Flexible hours. </strong>More efficient late at night? Better before the sun rises? That&rsquo;s fine by us. We are looking for people who get the job done, not for people who work between 9am and 5pm.</li><br /><li><strong>Unlimited paid time off.</strong> We set high quarterly goals, but give people the freedom to choose when and how to recharge. Join a team that trusts you with the job. And unlike some teams, we really mean it. Last year, the average Simprints employee took a total of 31 days off (annual leave plus UK bank holidays), an increase from 26 days two years ago.</li><br /><li><strong>Fieldwork around the world.</strong> We make sure that every role&mdash;from software engineer to strategic partnerships lead&mdash;gets a chance to travel with the team and see our impact in person if they want to. 100% optional. </li><br /><li><strong>Development and wellbeing</strong>. A generous Eduprints budget to spend on individual learning. In the past, Simprints engineers have spent this on attending tech conferences, enrolling in a Udacity nanodegree, and all the books you could possibly read.</li><br /><li><strong>Quarterly free hacking. Two &lsquo;LEGO Days&rsquo; each quarter where you can work on any project you want. Past projects have ranged from exploring image processing techniques to building a LEGO train to deliver beer around the office.</strong></li><br /></ul>",

How will we contact you about giving you your bonus? Tell your referral to list your name and/or email in the âHow did you hear about this job?â question. Once theyâre hired, weâll make sure you get paid.*\n\n## About the Role\n\nIâm looking for someone who is smart, organized, and trustworthy to be my executive assistant. I place an extremely high value on proactivity, independence, and accountability. Bluntly, Iâm looking for a perfectionist who can be incredibly organized and extraordinarily protective of my time.\n\n## Summary\n\n* This is not an entry-level assistant position. You MUST have at least 2+ years experience working remotely as an executive assistant for an executive or business owner. Iâm looking for someone whose career goal is to be an assistant, not someone that sees being an assistant as a stepping stone to another career.\n* You are extremely protective of my time and finite energy levels and this shows in all facets of your role. Everything from our fast-paced check-in meetings, that you will run with a goal of running down your checklist as quickly as possible, to not needing emails between us starting with a please and ending with a thank you to save time. If you love direct clear communication that is as efficient as possible, you will love this role.\n* Youâll handle my business and personal details. This covers a wide variety of tasks including scheduling, email, maintaining relationships, making gift recommendations for family, and making personal appointments. This is a job for someone who enjoys and is motivated by variety.\n* You have a great positive attitude and are energized when you are juggling many tasks at the same time. If you feel a busy day is a happy day, this is a great role for you.\n* You are extremely trustworthy and have high personal integrity. You will be given access to personal and business information that needs to be kept absolutely confidential.\n* You want to be empowered to have complete ownership of your work and be accountable for it. I describe the desired outcome, and you have the flexibility to achieve it in the best way you see fit. Independent problem solving is essential.\n* Iâm not looking for someone who waits for me to give them a list of tasks to complete each day. Instead what I am looking for is someone who intercepts and handles incoming work, proactively takes work off my plate, and only leaves for me work that is truly the best use of my time.\n* This is a full-time remote position. So you can work anywhere in the United States during east coast business hours. We communicate with Slack, email, Zoom, phone, and project management tools.\n\n## Tasks and Responsibilities\n\n* Manage all of the day-to-day administrative tasks for me.\n* Manage my schedule, appointments, and calendar. Organize my time such that I only work on those very few tasks that are vital and actually move the business forward. Proactively intercept work and take it off my plate.\n* Handle all communications on my behalf (e.g. Calls, Emails, Social Media, Staff Questions, Meeting Follow-Up, Etc.)\n* Improve on and implement new systems and processes.\n* Prepare information and research and act as the point person for a wide variety of projects.\n* Handle personal details such as shopping, ordering gifts, scheduling personal appointments, and finding and scheduling local services.\n\n## Required Knowledge & Skills\n\n* The ability to manage multiple incoming requests, while ensuring they are relayed or handled at the appropriate time, in the necessary order, and in the correct manner.\n* The ability to never lose track of something that is sent to you. I need to completely trust your ability to not lose track of tasks and for you to communicate when it is complete or feedback is needed.\n* Working knowledge of typical online tools such as Trello, Google Drive/Docs/Sheets, Zoom.\n* The ability to learn very quickly. You will need to learn how to use dozens of different software tools to be effective.\nA systems mindset and the ability to clearly document processes so we can achieve consistent results every time.\n* Extreme attention to detail, pride in how few mistakes you can make, and the determination not to make the same mistake twice.\n\n## Education and Experience\n\n* At least 2+ years experience as a remote executive assistant for a business owner or executive.\n* Exceptional ability to efficiently communicate progress on multiple projects.\n* Highly organized and efficient.\n* Trustworthy with strong personal integrity.\n* Top-notch communication skills via email and phone, internally and with customers/vendors.\n* Proven ability to prioritize tasks.\n* Perfectionist, super attention to detail.\n* Since this is a remote position, you must be a self-starter, self-motivated, and able to work independently with minimal oversight.\n* Must be comfortable developing and working in a virtual relationship, and having a limited amount of face-time.\n* Experience managing admin paperwork required to run a business (e.g. HR paperwork, compliance documents, etc.).\n* Skilled at finding and managing contractors to complete a task, both professionally and personally. For example, finding a copywriter freelancer to do some copy work. Or finding someone to come clean out a clogged house gutter as soon as possible.\n \n## About Prometheus Interactive\n\nAt [Prometheus Interactive] (https://prometheusinteractive.com/) we find neglected, underperforming apps and make them amazing. Our brilliant and resourceful team does this by bolstering features and growing the user base within our apps. Our current portfolio consists of Android and iOS apps, as well as a web SaaS product.\n\nWe are a âsmall but mightyâ crew of professionals with a passion for enhancing apps.

Weâre spread out all over the world â The United States, Russia, the Philippines, and more. We will never make you come into an office.\n\nThe opportunity to work with an incredible group of motivated and supportive people\n\n## How To Apply\n\nBeing as detailed as possible, please answer the following in your cover letter:\n\nPlease tell me about yourself â your professional background and your experience in support work. Please be specific.\n\n* I accidentally left my sunglasses at a coffee shop this morning after my meeting. What can you do to get them back to me?\n* I need a new roof on the house. How would you go about accomplishing that goal?\n* I recently moved across the country, donât yet have a new dentist and Iâve run out of prescription toothpaste. How would you get me more?\n* I need to go to Chicago in the next month for 4 days for a conference. What steps would you take to help me?",
